# Hide Mock Location (Forked & Enhanced)
**Prevents detection of mock location**
**Supports Android 6–16**
**Test App**: **[MockLocationDetector](https://github.com/auag0/MockLocationDetector)**

> **❤️ Support the Original Developer:**
> This is a customized fork. Massive credits and support go to the original creator, **[auag0](https://github.com/auag0)**, for the core foundation of this module. Please consider checking out and starring the [original repository](https://github.com/auag0/HideMockLocation).

## 🌟 What's Fixed & Improved in This Fork?
This version introduces advanced context-awareness and critical bug fixes to make the module completely invisible to aggressive detector apps:
* **Context-Aware Anti-Honeypot:** Fixed the "Hooked" detection (red flags) in *MockLocationDetector*. The module now intelligently inspects the timestamp of `Location` objects. It ignores dummy objects created locally by detector apps and only manipulates genuine system GPS data, bypassing honeypot traps perfectly.
* **Syntax & Stability Patches:** Fixed Kotlin syntax parsing errors (e.g., `Settings\$Secure`) ensuring flawless compilation and stability, especially for builds executed on mobile IDEs.
